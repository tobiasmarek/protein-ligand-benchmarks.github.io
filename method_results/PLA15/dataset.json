    "This website collects the results of approximate computational chemistry methods and machine learning potentials computed in the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.9b01171\">PLA15 benchmark data set</a>.",
    "The PLA15 dataset features 15 models of protein-ligand complexes covering the interaction of the ligand with nearby amino acid residues. The systems range in size from 280 to 580 atoms. Reference interaction energies were obtained from fragment-based DLPNO-CCSD(T) calculations and represent the most accurate benchmark available for biomolecular systems of this size.",
    "The error of the tested method is expressed as a mean unsigned error and listed in kcal/mol or in percent relative to the average magnitude of the reference interaction energy in the set. The methods are divided into three categories: semiempirical quantum-mechanical calculations (SQM), atomistic machine learning potentials (ML), and the hybrid methods combining both approaches (SQM+ML).",
    "More results can be added via the <a href=\"https://github.com/protein-ligand-benchmarks/protein-ligand-benchmarks.github.io\">GitHub repository</a>, which also provides the PLA15 structures and a sample code performing the calculations on them. Contributions of new data are welcome!"
